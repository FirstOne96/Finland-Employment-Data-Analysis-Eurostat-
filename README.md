# Sectoral Employment Analysis in Finland

## 📊 Overview
This project investigates the distribution of employment across major economic sectors in Finland using data sourced from Eurostat. The data is aggregated into four sector groups:

- **A–F**: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, Mining, Manufacturing, Construction  
- **G–J**: Wholesale, Retail, Transport, Information and Communication  
- **K–N**: Financial, Real Estate, Scientific and Technical Activities  
- **O–U**: Public Administration, Education, Health, Arts, and Other Services

The goal is to provide insights into employment structure by computing descriptive statistics and visualizing key trends across Finnish regions.

## 📁 Data
The dataset includes employment figures (in number of persons employed per 1000 inhabitants) for Finnish regions, categorized by sector. The data was cleaned and aggregated using R.

## 📐 Statistical Summary
For each sector group, the following metrics are computed:

- Mean employment  
- Median employment  
- Standard deviation  
- Minimum employment  
- Maximum employment  

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Bar Plot**: Shows the average employment per sector group.
- **Boxplot**: Displays the distribution of employment per 1000 inhabitants across sectors.

These plots help compare both central tendencies and variability between sector groups.

## 🧠 Interpretation
"Number of employed persons per 1000 inhabitants" refers to how many people are employed within a specific sector relative to the total population in a region, normalized per 1000 residents to allow comparison across differently sized areas.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)
- Eurostat data
